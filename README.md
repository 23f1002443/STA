# STA Lab Experiments

Welcome to my STA (Synchronous Timing Analysis) lab repository! This project showcases various digital logic modules and timing constructs designed in Verilog.

## Overview

A collection of STA-focused experiments aimed at exploring:

- Fundamental sequential & combinational circuits  
- Timing challenges in synchronous digital systems  
- Multi-clock domain interactions and pipeline architectures  

---

##  Project Structure

Each folder contains a Verilog module and corresponding   simulation setup:

- **4bitcounter/** – Synchronous 4-bit binary counter  
- **register/** – D flip‑flop register  
- **rca/** – Ripple‑carry adder  
- **buffer/** – Repeater/buffer for signal integrity  
- **delay/** – Fixed-path delay module  
- **clockskew/** – Clock skew modeling  
- **dualclock/** – Dual-clock domain synchronizer  
- **pipeline/** – Multi-stage pipeline implementation  

Additional setup steps are documented in `steps.txt`.

##  Usage

1. Navigate to a module folder, e.g., `cd 4bitcounter/`  
2. Review or customize the Tcl/simulator script  
3. Run simulation to generate waveforms or timing data
